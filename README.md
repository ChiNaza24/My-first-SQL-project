# My-first-SQL-project
This is my first project in SQL, after watching and learning from a series of videos on SQL as a growing Data Analyst.
The simple purpose of this project is to consolidate key customer metrics and behaviours as well as the key product metrics and behaviours. This gives insight to customer's behaviour with certain products depending largely on time of the year.
Key performance indicators are calculated and identified to help understand customers and their relationship with products better.
